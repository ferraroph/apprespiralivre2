# Squads System Implementation

## Overview
The Squads system has been fully implemented according to the requirements in task 4 of the MVP completion spec. This feature allows users to create and join groups (squads) where they can support each other in their quit smoking journey.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Edge Functions (Backend)
Created three serverless functions in `supabase/functions/`:

- **create-squad**: Creates a new squad with validation
  - Validates name (required, max 50 chars)
  - Validates description (optional, max 200 chars)
  - Automatically adds creator as leader
  - Sets max_members to 10

- **join-squad**: Allows users to join existing squads
  - Checks if squad exists
  - Validates user isn't already a member
  - Enforces max_members limit
  - Adds user as regular member

- **leave-squad**: Handles leaving squads
  - Removes user from squad
  - Transfers leadership to oldest member if leader leaves
  - Handles edge cases gracefully

### 2. Frontend Components
Created comprehensive React components in `src/components/`:

- **SquadList.tsx**: Browse and join squads
  - Displays all squads with member counts
  - Shows squad_streak for each squad
  - Join squad button with validation
  - Loading and error states
  - Empty state with create prompt

- **SquadDetail.tsx**: Squad information page
  - Displays squad name, description, and stats
  - Shows member list with profiles
  - Squad leaderboard ranked by current_streak
  - Leave squad functionality
  - Leader identification with crown icon

- **SquadChat.tsx**: Real-time chat with Supabase Realtime
  - Subscribes to squad_messages table
  - Displays messages chronologically
  - Send message functionality
  - User avatars and names
  - Auto-scroll to latest message
  - Message timestamps

- **CreateSquadDialog.tsx**: Squad creation form
  - Name input with validation
  - Description textarea (optional)
  - Character count indicators
  - Success/error handling
  - Navigates to new squad on success

### 3. Pages
Created page components in `src/pages/`:

- **Squads.tsx**: Main squads page (uses SquadList)
- **SquadDetailPage.tsx**: Squad detail page (combines SquadDetail + SquadChat)

### 4. Navigation & Routing
Updated navigation and routing:

- Added `/squads` route in App.tsx
- Added `/squads/:id` route for squad details
- Added "Squads" link to DesktopSidebar with UsersRound icon
- Added "Squads" link to MobileNav
- Active state handling for squad routes

## Database Requirements

The following database tables are required (from migration 1.3):

```sql
-- squads table
CREATE TABLE squads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  max_members INTEGER DEFAULT 10,
  squad_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- squad_members table
CREATE TABLE squad_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  squad_id UUID REFERENCES squads ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role TEXT CHECK (role IN ('leader', 'member')),
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  UNIQUE(squad_id, user_id)
);

-- squad_messages table
CREATE TABLE squad_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  squad_id UUID REFERENCES squads ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Edge Functions
```bash
supabase functions deploy create-squad
supabase functions deploy join-squad
supabase functions deploy leave-squad
```

### 2. Verify Database Schema
Ensure the squad tables exist and have proper RLS policies:
- Run migration 1.3 if not already applied
- Verify RLS policies are in place
- Test trigger for squad_streak updates

### 3. Update Supabase Types
After migrations are applied, regenerate TypeScript types:
```bash
supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

### 4. Test the Feature
- Create a squad
- Join a squad
- Send messages in squad chat
- Leave a squad
- Test leader transfer when leader leaves

## Known Issues

### TypeScript Errors (Expected)
The current TypeScript errors in SquadList, SquadDetail, and SquadChat are expected because:
- The squad tables don't exist in the auto-generated Supabase types yet
- Once migrations are run and types are regenerated, these errors will resolve

### Realtime Subscription
Ensure Supabase Realtime is enabled for the squad_messages table in the Supabase dashboard.
